# This is a drum machine project for FreeCodeCamp certification.

DEMO: https://annefiger.github.io/Drum-machine/

### This project allows the user to play specific sounds on keypress or click of a specific button taking the element's id. The volume can be adjusted. When a button or a key is pressed the button is highlighted for about 1000ms. It uses React, Bootstrap and SASS. It is responsive.

### The sounds used are from [99 sounds](https://99sounds.org/). The sounds files had to be moved to the src/ folder and imported in the App.js files to work on GitHub, they were in the public folder initially to work in the local browser.
